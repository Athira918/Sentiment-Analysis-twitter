# Sentiment-Analysis-twitter
Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment behind textual data. It is widely applied to social media data, customer feedback, and reviews to analyze opinions. In this project, we conducted sentiment analysis on Twitter data using machine learning techniques.
**Data Collection and Preprocessing**
The dataset used was a Twitter training dataset containing labeled tweets.
Preprocessing steps included removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters.
Tokenization and text vectorization (TF-IDF) were applied for feature extraction.
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Visualizations such as word clouds and sentiment distribution graphs were used to understand the data.
Sentiment categories included positive, negative, and neutral.
**Model Training and Evaluation**
Several machine learning models were trained, including:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Na√Øve Bayes
The dataset was split into training and testing sets.
Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.
**Results**
The Logistic Regression model achieved the highest accuracy.
The classification report showed that positive sentiments were easier to classify than neutral ones.
The confusion matrix revealed some misclassifications, particularly between neutral and positive tweets.
**Conclusion**
This project demonstrated how sentiment analysis can be applied to social media data to classify tweets into different sentiment categories. By leveraging NLP techniques and machine learning models, we successfully analyzed and predicted sentiments with good accuracy. Future improvements can include using deep learning models like LSTMs for better results.
